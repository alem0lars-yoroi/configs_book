## Installed

Which software is installed in your system depends on what you should do.

For me, I just run Windows on a VM because I still need some Windows-only software, like development tools.

Below you will find some lists of installed software setups.

The one I'm currently using is *`alem0lars VM`*, so the installed software list is called *`alem0lars VM software`*.

### alem0lars VM software
