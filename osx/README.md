# `OSX` Setup Tutorial

There are two macro-steps:

1. **Installation**: Install `OSX` on your drive.
2. **Configuration**: Configure the installed OS and the associated software.

## Assumptions

* In the software setup I refer a lot to Lastpass because is where I store my software licenses among other things. Of course you can use that service (I strongly suggest it) but you can just skip that advice and manually insert licenses manually :)

## Installation

See [here](./installation/README.md).

## Configuration

See [here](./configuration/README.md).
