# Marked

## Installation

Install from Mac App Store

## Configuration

The configuration should be available through the *VCSH configuration for Marked* (the [configs-marked](github.com/alem0lars/configs-marked) repository contents)

## Known issues

* If you can't find the Custom CSS it's because unfortunately the preferences store the absolute path (including the username), so you need to manually open the `plist` file and replace `/Users/<my_username>` with `/Users/<your_username>`
