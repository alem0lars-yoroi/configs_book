# Fonts

You firstly need to have [Hombrew Cask](http://caskroom.io) installed with the `caskroom/fonts` repository tapped. Most software sets already provides it.

If you don't have it, [setup it](../software/list/package_manager.md).

Now setup fonts:

```ShellSession
$ brew cask install font-lato # Install the font Lato
```
