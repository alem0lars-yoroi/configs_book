# Minimal Development

This software set includes all of the software you need for developing:

* `iOS` software.
* `Cocoa` software.

## Software included

Install the software in the declared order:

* [**Package Manager**](../list/system/package_manager.md)
* [**Configuration Manager**](../list/system/configuration_manager.md): *Just install it, don't perform any other operation right now. We'll do these things later.* This is because we want to be sure software installation won't override our configurations installation. BTW, if you already performed other operations that's not a problem: running those operations later restores the right configurations.
* [**SSH**](../list/system/ssh.md)
* [**`XCode`**](../list/development/xcode.md)
* [**`Git`**](../list/development/git.md)
* [**`iStat`**](../list/monitoring/istat.md)
* [**`Adobe Air`**](../list/system/adobe_air.md)
* [**`Moom`**](../list/wm/moom.md)
* [**`Disk Doctor`**](../list/fs/disk_doctor.md)
* [**`DaisyDisk`**](../list/fs/daisydisk.md)
* [**`Archive Extractor`**](../list/fs/archive_extractor.md)
* [**`CheatSheet`**](../list/system/cheatsheet.md)
* [**`Apple Remote Desktop`**](../list/network/apple_remote_desktop.md)

Finally apply all configurations for the installed software: perform sync, instantiate and install the instance following the [Notes section](https://github.com/alem0lars/configs_book/blob/master/osx/configuration/software/list/system/configuration_manager.md#notes)
