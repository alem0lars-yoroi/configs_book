# `OSX` Installation

If needed (e.g. to perform a clean installation), [create a bootable USB installer](./tips/bootable_usb_installer.md).

Start the installer.

Next, create a *encrypted* and *case-sensitive* partition. The size choice varies:

* For a single-OS installation use the entire space with a single partition.
* For a dualboot installation don't use the entire space but be sure to leave enough space for other OSes.

Finally, install `OSX` on it.
